# 📚 CRT Training – Day 13: SQL Fundamentals and Relational Database Concepts

Welcome to Day 13 of my CRT (Campus Recruitment Training) program!  
Today was all about building a strong foundation in **SQL** and understanding the **concepts behind relational databases**, which are essential for backend development and data management.

## 📘 Basic SQL & Database Terminologies

### 🔹 Query
A **query** is a request to retrieve or manipulate data in a database using SQL statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.

### 🔹 Row (Record or Tuple)
A **row** is a single, horizontal entry in a table that represents a **record** of data. Each row contains values for every column in the table.

### 🔹 Column (Field or Attribute)
A **column** is a vertical section in a table that defines a specific attribute or **field** of the record, such as `name`, `age`, or `email`.

### 🔹 Table (Realtion)
A **table** is a collection of rows and columns used to store structured data in a database. Each table represents a specific entity.

### 🔹 Dataset
A **dataset** is a collection of data, often retrieved by executing a SQL query, and can include multiple tables or results.

### 🔹 Recordset
A **recordset** refers to the set of records (rows) returned from a query. It can be thought of as a temporary result stored in memory.

---

## 🗃️ Database Concepts

### 🔹 Database Objects
These are components used to store or manage data in a database. Examples include:
- **Tables** – Store data
- **Views** – Virtual tables generated by queries
- **Indexes** – Improve query performance
- **Stored Procedures** – Predefined SQL code
- **Triggers** – Code executed automatically in response to events

### 🔹 Schema
A **schema** is the structure that defines how data is organized in a database, including tables, columns, types, relationships, and constraints.

## 📚 Levels of Database Architecture

### 🔹 Three Levels of Database Abstraction:
1. **External Level**  
   - User’s view of the database
   - Tailored access to data based on user needs

2. **Conceptual Level**  
   - Logical structure of the entire database
   - Includes relationships, constraints, and data types

3. **Internal Level**  
   - Physical storage of data on hardware
   - Focuses on performance and data organization on disk

## 📐 Data Models

A **data model** defines how data is connected and stored. Types include:

1. **Hierarchical Model**  
   - Data is organized in a tree-like structure using parent-child relationships.

2. **Network Model**  
   - Uses a graph structure allowing many-to-many relationships.

3. **Relational Model**  
   - Stores data in tables (relations) and uses keys to establish relationships.

4. **Object-Oriented Model**  
   - Data is represented as objects, like in object-oriented programming.

## 🏗️ DBMS Architecture

### 🔹 Types of Architecture:
- **1-Tier Architecture** – Direct access to DB without any client-server model.
- **2-Tier Architecture** – Application (client) communicates with the DB directly.
- **3-Tier Architecture** – Client → Application Server → Database Server (most commonly used for scalability and security).

### 🔹 Components:
- **Query Processor**
- **Storage Manager**
- **Transaction Manager**
- **Buffer Manager**

## 🔄 Relationships in Databases

Defines how tables are related:

1. **One-to-One (1:1)** – Each record in one table is related to one in another.
2. **One-to-Many (1:N)** – A single record in one table relates to many in another.
3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)** – Multiple records in one table relate to multiple in another.

---

## 🧩 ER Model (Entity-Relationship)

An **ER Model** is a diagrammatic representation of database structure using:
- **Entities** – Real-world objects (e.g., Student, Course)
- **Attributes** – Characteristics of entities (e.g., name, ID)
- **Relationships** – Connections between entities

---

## ➕ Functional Dependencies

A **functional dependency (FD)** occurs when one attribute in a relation uniquely determines another attribute.  
**Notation**: `A → B` (If you know A, you can determine B)

Used for database **normalization** to eliminate redundancy.

---

## 📏 Normalization

A process to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and tables of a database:

1. **1NF (First Normal Form)** – Eliminates repeating groups, each cell contains atomic values.
2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)** – Removes partial dependencies (requires 1NF + full functional dependency).
3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)** – Removes transitive dependencies (non-key attribute depending on another non-key).
4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** – A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

---

## 🔑 Types of Keys

- **Primary Key** – Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Candidate Key** – A minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.
- **Super Key** – Any combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a record (may not be minimal).
- **Foreign Key** – A key in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
- **Composite Key** – A key made up of two or more columns.

---

## 🧾 SQL Clauses

SQL provides different clauses to retrieve and manipulate data:

- `SELECT` – Retrieves data from the database
- `FROM` – Specifies the table to query
- `WHERE` – Filters records based on conditions
- `GROUP BY` – Groups records with the same values
- `HAVING` – Filters groups based on conditions
- `ORDER BY` – Sorts the result set
- `JOIN` – Combines rows from multiple tables

## 🧠 Summary

This session helped build a foundational understanding of **SQL** and **Relational Database Design**. From learning how data is structured to normalizing data for efficiency and understanding query structure, it provides the theoretical groundwork for writing optimized database queries and designing scalable systems.
