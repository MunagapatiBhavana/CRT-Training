## 🤔 Fun Brain Teaser: Left-Handed Logic!

Let's say in a class,

🧍‍♂️ 99% are left-handed

🫱 Only 1 person is right-handed

Now, the question is:

How many left-handed people must leave so that the percentage of left-handers becomes 98%?

## 🧠 Let’s Solve It Logically:
Let the total number of people be x.

Since 1 person is right-handed and 99% are left-handed:

0.99 𝑥 = Left-Handers

0.99x=Left-Handers

0.01 𝑥 = 1

⇒ 𝑥 = 100

0.01x=1 ⇒ x=100

So initially:

Left-Handed = 99

Right-Handed = 1

Total = 100

Now, let y be the number of left-handers who go out.

New total people = 100 − 𝑦

New left-handers = 99 − 𝑦

We want:

    99-y / 100-y = 0.98

🔢 Solving: 


99−y / 100−y = 98/100

=> 100(99−y)=98(100−y)

​
 
9900 − 100 𝑦 = 9800  − 98𝑦

⇒100 = 2𝑦

⇒𝑦=50
9900−100y=9800−98y⇒100=2y⇒y=50

✅ Answer:
50 left-handed people must leave to make it 98% left-handers in the class!

🎉 A mix of math and a chuckle for  training session!
